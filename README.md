Dog-Cat Classification using CNN

Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images to differentiate between the two categories.

Features

Data preprocessing including resizing, augmentation, and normalization.

CNN model architecture with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

Training and validation split for model evaluation.

Model performance analysis using accuracy and loss metrics.

Optional transfer learning using pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet.

Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (>=3.7)

TensorFlow/Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

OpenCV (optional for additional image processing)

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Install dependencies using:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn pandas

Dataset

The dataset should contain two folders:

dogs/ - containing images of dogs

cats/ - containing images of cats

You can use datasets such as:

Kaggleâ€™s Dogs vs. Cats dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:

Convolutional Layers (Conv2D) with ReLU activation

Max Pooling Layers

Flatten Layer

Fully Connected Dense Layers

Softmax Activation for Classification
